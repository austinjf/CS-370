# CS-370

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project I developed a reinforcement learning model by implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm, specifically an epsilon-greedy algorithm, that trains an AI agent move from a starting point to a designated end point. I was given code for a game where a pirate (the AI agent) moves across a grid (maze) with obstacles to the treasure (end point). I was given code for the generation of the maze and code for storing/analyzing the experience of the AI agent. I was also given the code for general structure of the game, but I implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm and reinforcement learning myself.


# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer science is a wide field from front end web developers, back-end developers, software application developers, and even data scientists. Data scientists implement machine learning models like these into all aspects of our lives from social media, advertising, GPS traffic management, and so on. 


# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I always approach a problem by first understanding what the user requirements are and learning more about the problem Iâ€™m trying to solve. I then break the problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks. I then identify how those chunks can be translated into how a machine would understand it and implement a solution by working my way back up until I have a working product. Once I have a working product, I then further refine the software by cutting out inefficiencies and ensuring that it meets the user requirements.


# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities are to act with the interest of the everyday person in mind, to act in the best interests for my employer/organization and create software that meets the professional standards of others in my field. It is also my responsibility to never stop learning new software, and continue to learn new things as the field of computer science grows.
